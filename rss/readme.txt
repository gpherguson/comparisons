Just some quick doodles to read Guitar Center's used-equipment feed and turn it into a HTML page. "Why?", you ask. I don't know. It was an interesting exercise to do in Python and, being obsessive/compulsive, I went over board and did it in Perl and Ruby too as a comparison.

No guarantee is implied or given with this code. It worked once for me and might work again but your experience might be different.
