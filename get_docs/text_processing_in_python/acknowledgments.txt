FRONTMATTER -- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Portions of this book are adapted from my column _Charming
  Python_ and other writing first published by -IBM
  developerWorks-, <http://ibm.com/developerWorks/>. I wish to
  thank IBM for publishing me, for granting permission to use this
  material, and most especially for maintaining such a general and
  useful resource for programmers.

  The Python community is a wonderfully friendly place. I made
  drafts of this book, while in progress, available on the
  Internet. I received numerous helpful and kind responses, many
  that helped make the book better than it would otherwise have
  been.

  In particular, the following folks made suggestions and
  contributions to the book while in draft form. I apologize to any
  correspondents I may have omitted from the list; your advice was
  appreciated even if momentarily lost in the bulk of my saved
  email.

    Suggested glossary entries for CRC and hash.

    Various organizational ideas while in draft.  Then he wound
    up acting as one of my technical reviewers and provided a
    huge amount of helpful advice on both content and
    organization.

  Mike Dussault <dussault@valvesoftware.com>

    Found an error in combinatorial HOFs and made good
    suggestions on Appendix A.

    A great deal of subversive entertainment, despite not
    actually fixing anything in this book.

    brought both erudition and an eye for detail to the job.

  Sergey Konozenko <sergey_konozenko@ieee.org>

    Boosted my confidence in final preparation with the
    enthusiasm he brought to his technical review--and even more
    so with the acuity with which he "got" my attempts to impose
    mental challenge on my readers.
